This is the code we wrote for our robotics team which played this year's BEST Robotics game, Gatekeeper.

An EasyC version is available in /EasyC, while a plaintext .c with lots of extra comments is available in /Plaintext.

The EasyC version requires EasyC v4 for Cortex. Not tested with other environments like ROBOTC.
